# React Playground (01)

This is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/evedes/ReactRouter_Boilerplate_01) by [evedes](https://github.com/evedes/). 

It is a simple website with 4 pages with a persistent logo, navigation and footer with only the content changing. I started off following [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/hitchhikers-guide-to-react-router-v4-a957c6a5aa18) to understand how to set up Router to do this. 

I'm now using this repo to learn managing state and data flow within components, as well as using React's Context API to pass state between components that might not have the parent > child relationship.
